This repository demonstrates an uncommon error in Python that can occur during arithmetic operations when dealing with lists containing mixed data types. Specifically, this example shows a `TypeError` arising from attempting to divide an integer by a string.  The solution highlights the importance of data type validation and careful handling of lists to prevent such unexpected errors. The code includes comprehensive error handling to gracefully manage these scenarios, demonstrating best practices for robust programming.
